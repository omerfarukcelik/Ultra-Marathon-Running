# Ultra-Marathon-Running
## Overview
This project focuses on an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of ultra-marathon running data using Python and the Pandas library. The analysis is conducted within a Jupyter Notebook environment, with the dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal of the project is to uncover insights about ultra-marathon running, including trends, patterns, and performance metrics of participants over time.

## Features
* **Data Source**: The ultra-marathon running dataset is sourced from Kaggle, which includes various features such as race details, participants' performance metrics, and other relevant data.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis**: This project provides a comprehensive EDA, including:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Summary statistics of the dataset.
  - Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to observe trends and patterns.
## Tools and Libraries Used
* **Python**: The main programming language used in this project.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: All code and analysis are contained within a Jupyter Notebook for ease of execution and presentation.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
## Key Steps in the Analysis
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for manipulation and analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning**: This includes handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring that the dataset is ready for analysis.
3. **Data Visualization**:
Histograms to show the distribution of race times and distances.
Box plots to detect outliers in race performance.
Scatter plots to explore correlations between variables like age, race time, and distance.
## Dataset
The ultra-marathon running dataset can be found on Kaggle here (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running?resource=download).

Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook before running the analysis.

## Conclusion
This EDA project provides a deep dive into the world of ultra-marathon running using Python and data analytics. By exploring the dataset, we gain valuable insights into what makes ultra-marathon runners successful and how performance varies across different groups.
